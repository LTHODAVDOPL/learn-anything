[Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) is a project to organize world's knowledge, accelerate the rate at which people learn by curating the most efficient paths one can take to gain full understanding of any given topic.

## Contributing

Since this website is fully open source, you can help and add new and awesome features to the website. Please read our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#readme) for different ways on how you can do this.

If you have never programmed before and this is your first open source project, don't be afraid to join in. There are many people that can help you both get started and make your first contribution.

## Redesign

Here are some mockups kindly made by [Han Lyn](https://github.com/iinfin) for the next version of Learn Anything.

Explore page is still in the works but the idea is that there will be a Learn section centered around users creating study plans for learning anything and users searching for what they want to learn and choosing any of the available study plans. There will be tools for users to collaborate on improving the study plans together (initially with commenting) and in time, we can add ability to search over raw resources for any of the topics. The study plans are made with guided learning in mind so you can have resources starting from `Basic` to `Intermediate` to `Advanced`. The study plans can also lead to other study plans made by other users so not to redo the work done already.

## Curated Lists

With our goal of providing the most efficient paths for Learning Anything, we also manage curation of various curated lists. Feel free to [explore and improve them](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme).

## API

[Here](http://docs.learn-anything.xyz) you can find all the public API endpoints we currently have. We will be adding more in the future.

Below are some things people have built with the API we provide. If you built something yourself, feel free to add it to this list.

- [Alfred Workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything) - Alfred workflow to search through all Learn Anything maps.
- [Albert Plugin](https://github.com/nglgzz/albert-plugins) - Albert plugin to search through all Learn Anything maps.

## Roadmap

We share our [Roadmap](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/Roadmap) of things we are building now and hope to build next. Any help we can get on this is deeply appreciated.

## Keep this project going

This project is **built by the community, for the community** and in our goals to make the most efficient paths and the best user experience possible in exploring the maps and finding the resources you need, we can only rely on donations made by our users to sustain this project.

There are **no advertisements** and **no sponsored content** in this website as that would defeat our vision of making the best and most optimal learning tracks for learning any topic in the world.

We have created a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/learnanything) where you can support our work. Any donation that you make to this project is incredibly valuable to keep this project going. We also have some awesome rewards that come with your support.

## Team

Learn Anything would not be possible without a strong team of [contributors](../../contributors) helping push the project forward each day. Additionally, we have a core project team composed of:

- [**Angelo Gazzola**](https://github.com/nglgzz): Web developer. Created a complete working version of the website.
- [**Nikita Voloboev**](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev): Web developer. Curated the entire index of all the maps originally.
- [**Han Lyn**](https://github.com/iinfin): Designer. Designed the mockups and helps us design the feel and look of Learn Anything.

## Thank you

To all the people who contributed to this project and this vision of liberating and visualizing knowledge in this unique way.

Deepest thanks goes to our Patrons:
